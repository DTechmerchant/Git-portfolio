Learning software development through the software development life cycle (SDLC).

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by software developers to design, develop, test,
and deploy high-quality software. Here are the typical phases of the SDLC:

Planning:

Objective: Define the project scope, goals, and objectives.
Activities: Conduct feasibility studies, allocate resources, define timelines, and develop project plans.

Requirements Analysis:

Objective: Gather and analyze business and technical requirements.
Activities: Engage with stakeholders to understand their needs, document requirements, and create a requirements specification.

Design:

Objective: Create the architecture and design of the software.
Activities: Develop high-level system architecture, detailed design documents, data models, and user interfaces.

Implementation (Coding):

Objective: Convert design documents into actual code.
Activities: Write, compile, and integrate code based on the design specifications.
Testing:

Objective: Ensure the software is functional, reliable, and free of defects.
Activities: Conduct various tests (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing) to identify and fix bugs.

Deployment:

Objective: Make the software available for use in a live environment.
Activities: Deploy the software to production, perform configuration, and ensure everything is operational.

Maintenance:

Objective: Provide ongoing support and updates to the software.
Activities: Fix bugs, make enhancements, update documentation, and ensure the software continues to meet user needs.
